# my-first-game
The code for my first game. 


Attack enemies by inputting an integer n between(and including) 0 and 4. 
This will cause the health of enemies in that row to be decreased by 1. 

After attacking, all enemies will move forward one space and new enemies will spawn in the back row. 

If an enemy reaches the front row, the castle will be lost and the game will be over. 

How long can you defend your castle?
